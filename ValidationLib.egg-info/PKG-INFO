Description: """
        **ValidationLib** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive validation tools
        designed to validate AIR's Touchstone platform both easy and intuitive. It
        aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical,
        **accurate** validation in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal
        of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis /
        manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on its way
        toward this goal.
        pandas is well suited for many different kinds of validations:
          - Loss Analysis
          - Financial Module
          - Exports
